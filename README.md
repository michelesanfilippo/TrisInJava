# TrisJAVA
Simple tris made in java, where the game board is a 3x3 matrix and the players are 0 and 1.
The first player is randomly chosen, every time you insert your symbol(0 or 1 aswell) the game checks if you did a tris, if you choose an already taken place you'll get an error message and be able to choose another place

the map will be >

(0,0) (0,1) (0,2)

(1,0) (1,1) (1,2)      all the i,j will be initializated with -1, so -1 is free place.   

(2,0) (2,1) (2,2)
